Description: libkrun -- runtime
 libkrun is a dynamic library that allows programs to easily acquire
 the ability to run processes in a partially isolated environment
 using KVM Virtualization on Linux and HVF on macOS/ARM64.
 .
 It integrates a VMM (Virtual Machine Monitor, the userspace side of
 an Hypervisor) with the minimum amount of emulated devices required
 to its purpose, abstracting most of the complexity that comes from
 Virtual Machine management, offering users a simple C API.
